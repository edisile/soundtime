Make sure to replace the "ffmpeg" file in this directory with a real static 
build of FFmpeg supporting vorbis. Such a build can be made from the source 
code available at 

					https://source.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg 

or retrieved form a reputable source such as 

					https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg
					
that makes available unofficial static builds in both stable and git-master 
flavours. Once placed in this directory the lambda function will be ready to be 
deployed.

Another dependency of this function is the TinyTag library used for parsing the 
metadata of the music files uploaded to the S3 bucket; to get this dependency 
just execute the following command:
					
					pip install tinytag --target=./
